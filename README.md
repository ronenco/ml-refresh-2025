# ML Refresh 2025 🚀

This is a personal machine learning refresh and skill-building repository.  
It covers hands-on projects starting from classic ML to deep learning, with a focus on signal and time-series data — bridging from algorithm engineering to applied AI.

---

## 📌 Goals

- Rebuild ML fluency using modern tools and best practices
- Apply deep learning to signal data (I/Q, time-series)
- Develop a small but polished portfolio of projects
- Prepare for a pivot toward AI/ML-focused roles in industry
