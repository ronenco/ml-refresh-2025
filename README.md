# ML Refresh 2025 🚀

This is a personal machine learning refresh and skill-building repository.  
It covers hands-on projects starting from classic ML to deep learning, with a focus on signal and time-series data — bridging from algorithm engineering to applied AI.

---

## 📌 Goals

- Rebuild ML fluency using modern tools and best practices
- Apply deep learning to signal data (I/Q, time-series)
- Develop a small but polished portfolio of projects
- Prepare for a pivot toward AI/ML-focused roles in industry

## 🧭 Week-by-Week Plan

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| 1    | Signal simulation and feature extraction |
| 2    | ML model training and evaluation |
| 3    | Feature engineering and model tuning |
| 4    | CNNs, spectrograms, and signal classification |
| ...  | (continues in 10-week plan PDF) |

### 📌 Week 1: Signal Simulation & Feature Engineering
Objectives
Simulate synthetic I/Q signals with clean, noisy, faded, and jammed interference.

Extract both statistical and spectral features (e.g., mean, std, kurtosis, PSD).

Visualize time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics.

Create labeled datasets for use in downstream ML pipelines.


## ✍️ Notes

- Code is written clearly for reusability and readability.-
-  Each notebook includes markdown explanations and clean outputs.
- Private for now. Will be made public once a few sessions are cleaned and complete.
